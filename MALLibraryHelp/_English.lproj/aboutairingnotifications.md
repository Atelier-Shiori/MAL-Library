Shukofukurou can notify you about episodes that started airing that are on your list. You will recieve notifications from entries that have a watch status of watching or plan to watch. New airing notifications are checked every 10 mins. 

Note that you do not need to have Shukofukurou running to be notified. However, you need to run the program once in a while to referesh the notifications recieved. You can also fetch for new airing notifications manually by refreshing the anime list for the list source you use for Airing Notifications.

**Note: If you use a list source other than AniList, you may not recieve notifications from some titles since they may not be included in AniList's database.**

## Preferences
* Enable Air Notifications - This setting allows you to enable/disable Airing Notifications.
* Air Notification List Source - This specifies which library Shukofukurou should use to generate air notifications.
* Notifying Titles - This shows a list of titles you will recieve notifications for. You can enable or disable notifications by checking the check box besides the title.
