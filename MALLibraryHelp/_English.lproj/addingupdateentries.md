Shukofukurou makes it easy to add and update new titles to your list.

## Updating existing entries

Yiu can update existing entries by double clicking on a title on your list (if "Modify Title" is set for double click action),  clicking the pencil toolbar icon (edit), or right clicking an entry and choose "Edit Entry." A popover will appear. This popover allows you to update an entry on your list.

Choosing to do an Advanced Edit allows you to modify more options, like setting a library entry to private, rewatching, start/end dates, tags and notes. You can do an Advanced Edit by clickng the "Advanced Edit" button.

**Note:** Once the start and end dates are set, they cannot be removed.

## Adding titles

By clicking the + button, you can add a title. You can add titles from search view, season browser and airing browser as long the title doesn't exist on your list. Like with updating existing entries, a popover will appear when you add new titles to your list. To modify other fields such as private state, start/end dates, tags, etc., add the title to your list first.

## Increment
The Increment toolbar button in Anime or Manga list allows you to quicky increment the episodes you watched for anime and chapters you read for Manga by one. Once the Episode or Chapters reach the total numbers of episodes or chapters (if the value is greater than zero), it will be marked as complete. If you increment a planned to watch/read entry, its status will be changed to watching/reading.

You can also increment your progress by right clicking an entry.

## Custom Lists (AniList)
The Modify Custom Lists button allows you to add or remove titles from your custom lists. The custom lists feature allows you to organize titles into different lists besides watch/read status. Currently, you cannot add or remove custom lists within Shukofukurou. You can view your custom lists by clicking the custom list button on the tab bar. To leave a custom list, click on any of the status tabs.

**Note:** Viewing and managing custom lists are only available for people who donated or download the application off the Mac App Store.
