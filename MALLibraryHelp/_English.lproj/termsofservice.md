This is the terms of service when using the default API server. For the software license, see the License topic in the help file.

**Limits on Usage** You may use the Unofficial MAL API server (malapi.ateliershiori.moe, malapi.malupdaterosx.moe) at no cost with official builds of MAL Updater OS X and MAL Library without restrictions. You may not use this API server if you use self-compiled versions. If you are caught using the official API server on an unofficial copy, it's considered piracy and a cease and desist will be sent.

You can check the code signature using the terminal (codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/MAL\ Library.app). The authority must match the following: Developer ID Application: James Moy (9HDZTER525) or Apple Mac OS Application Signing (from the Mac App Store)

**Usage of Account Data** The Unofficial MAL API server does not store any user credentials. Account information is only used to retrieve data from MyAnimeList in a usable format that the application can use and perform update operations (such as updating library entries).

**Other Application Access to the MAL API server** While access to the server for other uses besides official copies of MAL Updater OS X and MAL Library, you may use the MAL API server for a small yearly fee. The fee is used to upkeep the server. Send an email to ateliershiori@chikorita157.com if you are interested.
