## Terms of Use (Unofficial MAL API server)

This is the terms of service when using the default API server.

### Limits on Usage

You may use the Unofficial MAL API server (malapi.ateliershiori.moe or malapi.malupdaterosx.moe) freely with official builds of MAL Updater OS X and MAL Library without restrictions. You may not use this API server if you self-compiled versions. If you are caught using the official API server on an unofficial copy, a cease and desist will be sent.
You can check the code signature using the terminal (codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/MAL\ Updater\ OS\ X.app). The authority must match thee following: Developer ID Application: James Moy (9HDZTER525) or Apple Mac OS Application Signing (from the Mac App Store)

### Usage of Account Data

The Unofficial MAL API server does not store user credentials. Account information is only used to retrieve data from MyAnimeList in a usable format that the application can use and perform update operations.

### Other Application Access to the MAL API server

While access to the server for other uses besides official copies of MAL Updater OS X and MAL Library is restricted, you may use the MAL API server for a yearly fee. The fee is used to upkeep the server. Send an email to ateliershiori@moyit.pro if you are interested.
